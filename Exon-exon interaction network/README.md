**This folder can be used to exon-exon interaction (EEI) networks based on three approaches: contact-based, PISA-based, and EPPIC-based**
- There are three subfolders, one corresponding to each of the approaches to create an EEI network
- The folders are numbered and should be executed in the ascending order.
- That is, first execute the scripts within the subfolder "1-contact-based"
- Then, execute the scripts within the subfolder "2-PISA-based"
- Lastly, execute the scripts within the subfolder "3-EPPIC-based"
- Within a subfolder, the scripts should be executed in the numberred order
